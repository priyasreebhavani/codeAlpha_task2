## Online training module on phishing attacks
As a part of this internship,I've built an online training module about phishing attacks. The module is named as "Phishing Attacks Awareness". I have created this module using an online platform named Teacable.
By building this module,I get to know about the phishing attacks,its types,measures taken to prevent phishing attacks and more. While workin on this module,I recognised how dangerous these attacks and also how 
important for every individual to get aware of these threats.
I hope this training module will give an in depth understanding for the reader.
